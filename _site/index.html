More than 100 stealth egg attacks baffle one Euclid homeowner and police
(photos and video) EUCLID, Ohio -- An 85-year-old Euclid man's home has
become the target of mysterious egging attacks that began in March 2014
and haven't stopped. The continuous onslaught of eggs has baffled
police, neighbors and local government officials who have tried and
failed to identify the source of the attacks that have ruined the man's
home and kept his family on edge. "The accuracy is phenomenal," Albert
Clemens, Sr. said. "Because almost every time when it's nice weather and
they launch five or six of these at a time, they almost invariably hit
the front door." Clemens green two-story house sits on the corner of
Wilmore Avenue and East 210th Street. He and his wife bought the home as
newlyweds about 60 years ago. Though his wife has since passed away,
Clemens still lives there with his 49-year-old daughter and 51-year-old
son. The house has been pelted with eggs several times a week --
sometimes more than once a day -- for the past year. The attacks always
happen after dark and last around 10 minutes each. The family has been
awoken as late as 2 a.m. by what sounds like the crack of a gunshot
against the aluminum siding or front door. Clemens and police believe
the eggs are being launched from a block or two away. The siding on the
front of Clemens' home is destroyed, splattered with dried egg residue
that stripped off the paint. Other than a few rogue eggs that hit nearby
homes, no other neighbors have been targeted. "Somebody is deeply,
deeply angry at somebody in that household for some reason," Euclid Lt.
Mitch Houser said. Winter offered a short respite for the family, as the
egging became less frequent during the cold weather. But both Clemens
and police anticipate the attacks picking back up as the snow and ice
thaw. An unsolved mystery Euclid police have not taken the investigation
lightly. They've spent a year doing undercover stakeouts, canvassing the
neighborhood and even sending eggshells for testing. The department's
entire community policing unit was dedicated to tracking down the eggers
at one point. Officers respond quickly to every egging call at the home
-- which is less than a mile from the police station. Both Clemens and
detectives are at a dead end when it comes to suspects. Clemens had
suspicions about a young man across the street who confronted him a
couple years ago and asked him to stop calling police about suspicious
activity in the neighborhood. Clemens said that he had started calling
police more often as he noticed more crime -- mostly suspected drug
activity. Another neighbor Clemens suspected was ruled out when officers
saw him standing outside as an attack occurred in the presence of
police. Investigators have taken several different approaches to nabbing
the eggers, including installing a surveillance camera on the house.
Detectives even collected some eggshell samples and tested them in a
crime lab. The eggs were traced back to a local Amish farm, but the
trail ended there. Clemens says the culprits either have access to a
large supply of eggs or are stealing them from businesses that throw
them out when they go bad. Detectives have followed this thread,
visiting local restaurants and businesses asking about missing eggs.
They've also tried collecting fingerprints from eggshells, but Houser
said that's an impossible task. When an egg breaks, it releases proteins
that destroy DNA. Officers have gone door to door questioning neighbors
and handing out fliers. Nobody has come forward with any tips. "The
person or people who are doing it have remained very tight-lipped
apparently," Houser said. "I would imagine it would be hard to keep a
secret of something that had been done hundreds of times and for nobody
to step forward to talk about it." The guilty parties don't appear to be
intimidated by police interest in the case. An officer last year was
taking a report when a barrage of eggs was launched at the house. One
hit him in the foot. Houser said he's never seen this level of vandalism
in his 20 years of police work. It's frustrated the whole department,
<div class='float-right'>
	<img src="/images/test.jpg" height="200px">
</div>
which has dedicated hundreds of hours toward solving the egging mystery.
"The man hours put into that investigation were huge and one of the
reasons it's so frustrating that we don't have somebody right now that
we can criminally charge," Houser said. The culprits will face charges
of felony vandalism and criminal damaging, Houser said. Additional
charges could be tacked on if investigators find evidence that the
attacks are a hate crime. The search continues Clemens is waiting until
the perpetrators are caught before he repairs the tarnished siding. His
insurance company is refusing to settle a claim until the guilty party
is found. He said he used to clean up after each attack, but it became
so frequent that he couldn't keep up. Police initially offered a $500
reward for information, but bumped it up to $1,000 after nobody came
forward. That money is still up for grabs. "We're not going to let it
go," Houser said. "We'll continue to put effort into it until we figure
something out." Despite all the torment, Clemens said he'd never
consider moving from his beloved home. "I like the neighborhood,"
Clemens said. "I like the city of Euclid. I would live and die in this
house -- but it's been kind of a nightmare."
